// Default overlay window placement (Task #59).
//
// Overlay windows persist their bounds the moment the user moves/resizes them, so this only
// ever decides where a kind appears the FIRST time it is opened (or after its stored bounds are
// cleared). The persisted position ALWAYS wins — see `overlayPlacement` in windows.ts, which
// prefers `cfg.bounds` and calls in here only when there are none.
//
// Layout: every kind docks to the BOTTOM-RIGHT of the primary display's work area, stacked
// upward in OVERLAY_KINDS order with a small gutter, so opening two or three overlays never
// lands one exactly on top of another. When the stack would run past the top of the work area it
// WRAPS INTO A NEW COLUMN to the left instead — with one uniform size that is exact, so no two
// kinds can ever overlap on their first open.
//
// SIZE IS UNIFORM across kinds (user decision): every overlay opens at the same width x height,
// whatever it renders. It is erring on the large side of the old per-kind values so the event
// log — the only kind that is a list rather than a handful of dense bars — is not cramped.
